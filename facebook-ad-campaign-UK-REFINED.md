## ALTERNATIVE UK-FRIENDLY VERSIONS

### Version A: More Conversational (52 seconds)
"If you're dealing with acne scarring, pigmentation, or stretch marks, you'll know how frustrating it can be. Our clinic offers CO2 laser treatment - a proper medical procedure that genuinely works. Our GMC-registered doctor has been doing this for over 20 years. The treatment creates microscopic channels that help your skin heal itself. We normally charge £450 per session, but if you're committed to the process and book two sessions upfront, we can do them for £350 each and throw in the PRP enhancement worth £100. It's the same standard you'd expect in Harley Street, but we're here in Prestwich. Worth a conversation if you're serious about addressing these concerns."

### Version B: Problem-Solution Focus (52 seconds)
"Acne scars and pigmentation can really knock your confidence. CO2 laser treatment is one of the few things that actually makes a proper difference. Our experienced team uses medical-grade technology to help your skin rebuild itself naturally. It's not cheap - £450 per session normally - but we do offer a package where two sessions cost £350 each, including PRP enhancement. That works out to £300 less than the individual price. We're based in Prestwich, fully regulated, with a GMC-registered doctor overseeing everything. If this sounds like something you'd consider, give us a call for a proper chat."

### Version C: Honest Direct (52 seconds)
"Let's be honest about skin concerns like acne scarring and pigmentation - they're difficult to treat properly. CO2 laser is one of the few treatments that genuinely works, but it needs to be done right. Our team has over 20 years experience, we're properly regulated with GMC oversight, and we use medical-grade equipment. Sessions are normally £450, or £500 with PRP. We do offer a package - two sessions for £350 each with PRP included - which saves £300 overall. It's not for everyone, but if you're serious about getting results, we'd be happy to have an honest conversation about whether it's right for you."
