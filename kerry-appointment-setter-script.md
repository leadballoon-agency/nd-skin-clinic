## When They Ask About "PRP for Free Deal"

### **Opening Response:**
"Ah brilliant, you've seen our video! Yes, the PRP for free deal is one of our most popular offers. Let me explain exactly how it works..."

### **The Explanation:**
"So normally, our CO2 laser sessions are £450 each, and if you want the PRP enhancement - which really does boost your results - that's usually an extra £50, making it £500 total.

But here's what we can do: If you're serious about getting the best results and book two sessions as a course of treatment, we can offer you both sessions for £350 each instead of £450. And instead of charging you the extra £50 for PRP on each session, we'll include it completely free.

So instead of paying £1000 for two sessions with PRP (that's £500 x 2), you'll pay just £700 total. That's a genuine saving of £300."

### **Benefits to Emphasize:**
- "The PRP really does enhance your healing and results"
- "Two sessions give you much better outcomes than just one"
- "You've got three months to have both treatments, so no rush"
- "It works out to fantastic value for what you get"

### **Qualifying Questions:**
1. "What specific skin concerns are you looking to address?"
2. "Have you had any laser treatments before?"
3. "Are you looking to book both sessions fairly close together, or spread them out?"
4. "Any questions about the PRP enhancement specifically?"

### **Handling Common Questions:**

**"What exactly is PRP?"**
"PRP stands for Platelet Rich Plasma. We take a small amount of your blood, process it to concentrate the healing platelets, then apply it to your skin after the laser treatment. It speeds up healing and can improve your final results significantly."

**"Do I have to book both sessions today?"**
"Not necessarily both dates today, but we do ask for commitment to the two-session package to get this pricing. We can book the first one now and schedule the second within your three-month window."

**"Can I think about it?"**
"Of course! The offer runs ongoing, so you're not under pressure. Would it help if I popped you in our diary for a consultation first? That way you can meet the team, see the clinic, and make sure you're completely comfortable before committing to anything."

**"Is this a limited time offer?"**
"It's one of our standard packages rather than a time-limited promotion. We find most people get much better results with a course of treatments rather than just one session, so we price it to encourage that approach."

### **Closing for Consultation:**
"The best next step is usually a consultation where you can meet our team, see the clinic, and get a proper assessment of your skin. The consultation is complimentary, and there's no obligation. Would [day/time] work for you?"

### **Closing for Direct Booking:**
"If you're ready to go ahead with the two-session package, I can get you booked in. We just need a small deposit to secure your dates, and you can pay the balance on the day of your first treatment. What dates work best for you?"

## Key Conversation Starters from Video

### **When they mention the video:**
- "Ah, you've seen our latest video!"
- "Great! What part caught your attention most?"
- "Perfect timing - that offer is exactly what most people are asking about"

### **If they're hesitant:**
- "I completely understand wanting to think it through"
- "Would a consultation help you decide? It's complimentary and no pressure"
- "Happy to answer any questions you have first"

### **Building confidence:**
- "Our team has been doing this for decades"
- "All our treatments are overseen by our GMC-registered doctor"
- "We're right here in Prestwich - no need to travel to London"

## Objection Handling

### **"It sounds expensive"**
"I understand that. When you break it down though, you're getting professional medical-grade treatment that usually costs £2000+ in London, plus the PRP enhancement worth £100, all for £700. Most people find it's actually excellent value for what they get."

### **"I need to discuss with my partner"**
"Of course! Why don't I send you some information you can share with them? Or if they have questions, they're welcome to call me directly."

### **"I'm not sure about two sessions"**
"That's totally understandable. Most people see good results with one session, but two really does make a significant difference. We could start with one session and see how you get on, then discuss the second?"

### **"What if I'm not happy with the results?"**
"We always do a thorough consultation first to make sure you're a good candidate. Our doctor will assess your skin and give you realistic expectations before any treatment. We want you to be delighted with your results."

## Follow-up Strategy

### **If they book consultation:**
- Send confirmation with clinic address and parking info
- Include brief "what to expect" information
- Call day before to confirm

### **If they need to think:**
- "No problem at all. Can I send you some more information?"
- "Would it help if I called you back in a few days?"
- "Any specific questions I can answer to help you decide?"

### **If they're not ready:**
- "That's fine. Can I keep your details in case anything changes?"
- "We sometimes have special offers - would you like me to let you know?"
- "Thanks for your interest - we're here when you're ready"

The key is to be helpful, not pushy, and always offer the consultation as a low-pressure next step.
